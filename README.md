# Img2VecCosSim-Django-Pytorch

Extract a feature vector for any image and find the cosine similarity for comparison using Pytorch. I have used ResNet-18 to extract the feature vector of images. Finally a Django app is developed to input two images and to find the cosine similarity.

#### Packages:
  - Pytorch
  - Django 2.0
